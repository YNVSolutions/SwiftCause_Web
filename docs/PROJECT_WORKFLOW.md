## 🎯 Project Overview

**SwiftCause** is a donation management platform that enables organizations to:
- Create and manage fundraising campaigns
- Deploy donation kiosks (physical or virtual)
- Process payments securely via Stripe
- Track donations and analytics in real-time
- Manage users with role-based permissions

### Core Concept
Organizations create campaigns → Assign campaigns to kiosks → Donors use kiosks to donate → Admins track everything via dashboard

## 🔒 Security & Performance

### Security Measures

#### 1. Authentication
- Firebase Authentication with email/password
- Session management with secure tokens
- Protected routes (admin-only pages)

#### 2. Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Permission checks before every action
- Organization-level data isolation

#### 3. Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Organization members can access org data
    match /campaigns/{campaignId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid))
        .data.organizationId == resource.data.organizationId;
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4. Data Validation
- Input sanitization on client-side
- Server-side validation in Cloud Functions
- Type safety with TypeScript

#### 5. PII Protection
⚠️ **Current Issue:** Donation data with PII (email, phone, name) is exposed to client
**Recommendation:** Use Cloud Functions to sanitize sensitive data

### Performance Optimizations

#### 1. Efficient Queries
- **Before:** Fetching all donations (10,000+ reads)
- **After:** Using `getCountFromServer()` (6 reads)
- Parallel queries with `Promise.all()`
- Indexed queries for fast lookups

#### 2. Code Splitting
- Next.js automatic code splitting
- Lazy loading of components
- Dynamic imports for heavy libraries

#### 3. Caching Strategy
- Browser caching for static assets
- Firebase SDK caching
- **Recommended:** Add React Query for data caching

#### 4. Image Optimization
- Next.js Image component
- Lazy loading images
- Responsive images with srcset

#### 5. Bundle Optimization
- Tree shaking unused code
- Minification in production
- Compression (gzip/brotli)

### Indexes Required

For optimal query performance, create these composite indexes in Firestore:

1. **campaigns**
   - `organizationId` (ASC) + `status` (ASC)
   - `organizationId` (ASC) + `raised` (DESC)
   - `organizationId` (ASC) + `endDate` (ASC)

2. **donations**
   - `organizationId` (ASC) + `timestamp` (DESC)
   - `organizationId` (ASC) + `amount` (ASC)
   - `campaignId` (ASC) + `timestamp` (DESC)

3. **kiosks**
   - `organizationId` (ASC) + `status` (ASC)

## 📝 Common Questions & Answers

### Q: How do organizations get paid?
**A:** Organizations connect their Stripe account during onboarding. Donations are processed through Stripe and automatically transferred to the organization's bank account according to their Stripe payout schedule.

### Q: Can one kiosk show multiple campaigns?
**A:** Yes! Kiosks can be assigned multiple campaigns. Donors can browse and select which campaign to support.

### Q: How are permissions managed?
**A:** The system uses role-based access control (RBAC). Each user has a role (super_admin, admin, manager, viewer) with specific permissions. Admins can create users and assign roles.

### Q: Is donor information secure?
**A:** Yes, all payment processing is handled by Stripe (PCI compliant). Donor information is stored in Firestore with security rules. However, we recommend implementing additional PII sanitization for production.

### Q: Can campaigns be scheduled?
**A:** Yes, campaigns have start and end dates. They can be set to activate/deactivate automatically.

### Q: How is the donation distribution calculated?
**A:** The system uses Firestore's `getCountFromServer()` to efficiently count donations in different amount ranges without downloading all documents. This is much more efficient than fetching all donations.

### Q: What happens if a kiosk goes offline?
**A:** The dashboard shows an alert for offline kiosks. Admins are notified and can investigate. Donations cannot be processed while offline.

### Q: Can donors get receipts?
**A:** Yes, Stripe automatically sends payment receipts. Organizations can also implement custom thank-you emails via Cloud Functions.
