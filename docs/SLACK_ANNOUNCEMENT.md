### 📚 MUST READ: Learn FSD

Before starting, **everyone must understand FSD**:

**Official FSD Resources:**
1. 🌐 **FSD Website:** https://feature-sliced.design/
2. 📖 **Get Started Guide:** https://feature-sliced.design/docs/get-started/overview
3. 🎓 **Tutorial:** https://feature-sliced.design/docs/get-started/tutorial
4. 💡 **Examples:** https://github.com/feature-sliced/examples

**Key Concepts to Understand:**
- ✅ **Layer hierarchy:** app → pages → widgets → features → entities → shared
- ✅ **Import rules:** Lower layers can't import from higher layers
- ✅ **Slice structure:** Each slice has `ui/`, `model/`, `api/`, `index.ts`
- ✅ **Public API:** Always export via `index.ts`

**⏰ Please allocate 2-3 hours to:**
1. Read the FSD overview
2. Watch a tutorial (YouTube has several)
3. Review our migration plan
4. Ask questions in thread below
